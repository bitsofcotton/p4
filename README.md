# p4
Get tm bit.

# Description
Get time machine bit from invariant observation, however, this can be getting broken result because of some another physical space collision or only flip observation as time machine bit (this can change invariant observation collision into some another combinations on high layers).

# Stub
This is only stub repository.
We need operators on F\_2^4 as invariant observation cohesion list.
If some another parallel executing computers on some range, this can get broken result as well.

# Tools are not enough
We need at least one concrete compiler and base system and base mpu, memory, ... (calculation system) as fully compatible and no harm on low of excluded middle.
Either, we need the list up method they harms on low of excluded middle as a parts (can we do this???)
